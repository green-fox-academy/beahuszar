//@EnableWebMvc (automatically added when spring-webmvc is noticed) flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
//@ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in this package, allowing it to find the controllers.
