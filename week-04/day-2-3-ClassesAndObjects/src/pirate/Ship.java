/*
The ship can be filled with pirates and a captain via fillShip() method.
    - Filling the ship with a captain and random number of pirates.
    - Ships should be represented in a nice way on command line including
        - information about captains consumed rum, state (passed out / died)
        - number of alive pirates in the crew
Ships should have a method to battle other ships: ship.battle(otherShip)
    - should return true if the actual ship (this) wins
      - the ship should win if its calculated score is higher
       - calculate score: Number of Alive pirates in the crew - Number of consumed rum by the captain
    - The loser crew has a random number of losses (deaths).
    - The winner captain and crew has a party, including a random number of rum :)
